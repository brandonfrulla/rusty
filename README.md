# Learning Rust

## Overview

This repository contains code, exercises, and projects related to my personal journey learning Rust through the "Rust Programming Language" book and other online resources.

## Structure

- `hc/`: Simple hello world in Rust.
- `guess_game/`: A guessing game built in Rust.
- `rust-frontend`: A simple web UI in Rust
- `tutorial2/`: Something about time that I can't remember doing.
- `concepts/`: Code snippets to understand Rust concepts.
- `projects/`: Small to medium scale projects.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need Rust and Cargo installed.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
